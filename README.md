# A Computer Science Journey
A Computer Science Journey is a progressive adventure into the realms of computers,
with a set of modern programming languages (Go/Rust) instead of the classical and natural
choices of C/C++. It's important to keep an eye on the future as technology evolves faster
than our ability of catching up.

## Update (04/02/2023)
Screw Rust, all hail the almighty C.
